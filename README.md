This repository contains the scripts used to generate and analyse the results discussed in the paper "Influence of tidal currents on transport and accumulation of floating microplastics in the global open ocean", by Miriam Sterl, Philippe Delandmeter and Erik van Sebille.

The directory *Tracking* contains all the scripts used to carry out the simulations. The other directories contain the scripts used to analyse the results.
